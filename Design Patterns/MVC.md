# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern ðŸ§©

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a fundamental architectural pattern commonly used in web development. It separates an application into three interconnected components, each with its specific role:

1. **Model:** The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It defines how data is structured, stored, and manipulated. In a web application, the Model interacts with the database and handles data-related operations.

2. **View:** The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It deals with the user interface (UI) and displays information from the Model. Views can be HTML templates or other UI components.

3. **Controller:** The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user input and decides how to respond to user actions. Controllers process requests, update the Model, and render the appropriate View.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Separation of concerns: MVC separates the application logic into distinct components, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- Reusability: Components (Models, Views, and Controllers) can be reused across different parts of the application.
- Testability: Each component can be tested independently, promoting code quality and reliability.

**Use Cases:**

- Web applications with complex data structures and user interfaces.
- Applications that require scalability and maintainability.
- Separation of front-end and back-end development.

**Example:**
A common implementation of MVC can be found in popular web frameworks like Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), and Spring MVC (Java). These frameworks provide built-in support for structuring applications using the MVC pattern.

In summary, the MVC pattern offers a clear structure for building web applications, facilitating the separation of concerns and promoting maintainability and scalability.
