# Singleton Pattern ☝️

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In web development, Singletons are often used to manage shared resources and maintain a single instance of a class.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Single Instance: A Singleton class allows only one instance to exist throughout the application's lifecycle.
- Global Access: The Singleton instance is globally accessible, providing a consistent interface for accessing the shared resource.

**Use Cases:**

- Managing shared resources such as database connections, configuration settings, or caches.
- Controlling access to resources that should be shared and accessed in a coordinated manner.

**Example:**
In a Node.js application, you can implement a Singleton to manage a database connection:

```javascript
// Singleton Database Connection
class Database {
  constructor(connectionString) {
    if (Database.instance) {
      return Database.instance;
    }
    // Initialize the database connection here
    this.connectionString = connectionString;
    Database.instance = this;
  }

  query(sql) {
    // Perform database queries here
    return `Query executed: ${sql}`;
  }
}

const db1 = new Database("db_connection_string");
const db2 = new Database("another_db_connection_string");

console.log(db1 === db2); // true (both variables reference the same instance)
```
