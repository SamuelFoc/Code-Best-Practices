# Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern üñºÔ∏è

The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern is a design pattern used primarily in client-side web development to separate the concerns of the user interface (View) from the underlying data and business logic (Model). MVVM is particularly popular in frameworks like Vue.js and Knockout.js.

**Components of MVVM:**

1. **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application. It defines how data is structured and manipulated, similar to the Model in MVC.

2. **View:** Represents the user interface (UI) and is responsible for displaying data to the user. It is analogous to the View in MVC.

3. **ViewModel:** Serves as an intermediary between the Model and the View. The ViewModel encapsulates the presentation logic, exposing data and methods that the View can bind to. It's a crucial part of MVVM that enables data binding.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Data Binding: MVVM leverages two-way data binding to automatically update the UI when data changes and vice versa.
- Separation of Concerns: MVVM cleanly separates the UI logic (ViewModel) from the UI structure (View).
- Testability: ViewModel logic can be unit-tested independently of the UI.

**Use Cases:**

- Client-side web applications with dynamic user interfaces.
- Applications requiring responsive and interactive UIs.
- When you want to maintain a clean separation between UI logic and UI presentation.

**Example:**
In a Vue.js application, you'll define a ViewModel using Vue components. The ViewModel contains data properties and methods that the View can bind to. Changes to the ViewModel automatically update the View, and user interactions trigger ViewModel methods.

```javascript
// Vue.js MVVM Example
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ greeting }}</h1>
    <button @click="changeGreeting">Change Greeting</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      greeting: "Hello, MVVM!",
    };
  },
  methods: {
    changeGreeting() {
      this.greeting = "Greetings from MVVM!";
    },
  },
};
</script>
```
