# 🚀 Code Practices in Web Development 🌐

This repository contains examples and explanations of good code practices in web development. The lessons cover essential design patterns and principles that help developers create clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

## 📖 Lesson 1: Design Patterns 🏗️

In the first lesson, we discussed various design patterns commonly used in web development. These patterns are essential for structuring your code, solving common problems, and building scalable web applications. The patterns covered include:

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** 🧩: Separates an application into Model, View, and Controller components for better organization.
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** 🖼️: Similar to MVC but focuses on client-side web development and data binding.
- **Singleton Pattern** ☝️: Ensures a class has only one instance, often used for managing shared resources.
- **Factory Method Pattern** 🏭: Provides an interface for creating objects while allowing subclasses to alter object creation.
- **Observer Pattern** 🔍: Defines one-to-many dependencies between objects, commonly used for handling events.
- **Dependency Injection (DI) Pattern** 🎁: Manages object dependencies by injecting them externally.
- **Repository Pattern** 🗄️: Abstracts data access, providing a consistent interface for different data sources.

## 📖 Lesson 2: Code Principles 📝

The second lesson focuses on fundamental code principles that every developer should follow to write clean and maintainable code. These principles include:

- **SOLID Principles** 🧱: Five principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) that guide object-oriented design for better modularity and flexibility.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** 🔄: Encourages code reuse and avoids duplication by maintaining a single source of truth for data and logic.
- **Design Patterns in Web Development** 🕸️: Examples of how these design patterns are applied in web development, with practical use cases.

Each lesson includes code examples and explanations to help you understand how to implement these practices in your web development projects.

Feel free to explore the examples and apply these practices to your own projects to write more maintainable and efficient code.

Happy coding! 🚀👨‍💻👩‍💻
